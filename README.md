Arduino electronic trumpet with air pressure sensor

Small project that combines both my scientific competencies and my harmonic passion for the musical arts.
Inspired by various "elctronic pianos" projects previously done with Arduino.
Three buttons mimic a trumpet's valve. 
You can blow inside a sensor to recreate a real trumpetâ€™s range of pitches. Nevertheless, the blowing mechanism still needs some development in order to perfect the simulation of blowing inside a real trumpet.
